== Description ==

A simple *Boilerplate to override all woocommerce templates

Once installed, woocommerce will use the templates in this plugin instead of it's own, so tinker with the them 'till your heart's content, 
and write all your styles in templates/css/woocommerce.css - There are the original files from Woocommerce and Oxygen in 'ref' - for your reference.

There is some debate about whether it's sensible or not to override all templates at once, but the point of this is to give you an easy starting point for completely customising Woocommerce, particulary if you're not working with a theme. You can simply remove any of the templates you haven't modified once you're done.
